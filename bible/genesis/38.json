This incident occurs after Tamar disguises herself as a prostitute, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures where veiling was used to conceal identity. The lack of recognition also reflects Judah's spiritual blindness and moral decline, contrasting with his earlier role in selling Joseph into slavery. This moment foreshadows later biblical narratives where identity plays a crucial role, such as Jacob's deception of Isaac and Joseph's brothers not recognizing him in Egypt.<p><b>he went over to her and said,</b><br>Judah's approach to Tamar signifies a departure from his familial responsibilities and a descent into moral compromise. This action takes place in the region of Enaim, a location that underscores the theme of \"eyes\" or \"sight,\" as the name suggests. The geographical setting serves as a backdrop for Judah's lack of spiritual insight. His decision to engage with a perceived prostitute reflects the cultural norms of Canaanite society, where such interactions were not uncommon, yet it also highlights the contrast between Canaanite practices and the ethical standards expected of the descendants of Abraham.<p><b>&#8220;Come now, let me sleep with you.&#8221;</b><br>Judah's proposition reveals his impulsive nature and susceptibility to temptation. This phrase underscores the moral challenges faced by the patriarchs and their descendants, illustrating the ongoing struggle between fleshly desires and covenantal faithfulness. The request also echoes the broader biblical narrative of sexual immorality leading to significant consequences, as seen in the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah and later in the life of King David. This moment serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of yielding to sinful impulses.<p><b>&#8220;What will you give me for sleeping with you?&#8221; she inquired.</b><br>Tamar's response indicates her awareness of the transactional nature of the encounter and her strategic thinking. In the ancient Near East, the exchange of goods or tokens was customary in such interactions, reflecting the economic dimensions of sexual relations outside of marriage. Tamar's question sets the stage for her securing Judah's personal items as a pledge, which becomes pivotal in the narrative. This exchange prefigures later biblical themes of redemption and restitution, as seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz, where a kinsman-redeemer plays a crucial role.<div class=\"vheading2\">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href=\"/topical/j/judah.htm\">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is a central figure in this account.

Earlier he had joined his brothers in deceiving Jacob with Joseph&#8217;s robe (<a href=\"/genesis/37-32.htm\">Genesis 37:32</a>); now he himself is the deceived one. Sin&#8217;s harvest is consistent (<a href=\"/galatians/6-7.htm\">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Tamar&#8217;s relationship to Judah carried covenant implications. Lever-rite duty (later codified in <a href=\"/deuteronomy/25-5.htm\">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>) required Judah&#8217;s family to preserve the line of his deceased sons. Judah had stalled, so the Lord allowed Tamar&#8217;s bold plan to bring justice and secure the promised seed (<a href=\"/matthew/1-3.htm\">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><hr color=\"#eeeeee\"><b>He went over to her</b><p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s movement toward the roadside woman shows deliberate choice, not accident. <a href=\"/james/1-14.htm\">James 1:14-15</a> reminds us that desire conceives sin before it is acted out.<p>&#8226; In contrast, Joseph&#8212;Judah&#8217;s younger brother&#8212;&#8220;fled&#8221; from Potiphar&#8217;s wife (<a href=\"/genesis/39-12.htm\">Genesis 39:12</a>). Scripture places these two accounts side by side to highlight the fork in the road that each believer faces (<a href=\"/psalms/1-1.htm\">Psalm 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The text also exposes Judah&#8217;s drift from his family&#8217;s covenant center. He is traveling away from home, away from worship, and into temptation, illustrating <a href=\"/1_corinthians/15-33.htm\">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>: &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character.&#8221;<p><hr color=\"#eeeeee\"><b>and said, &#8220;Come now, let me sleep with you.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The blunt request unmasks Judah&#8217;s heart.

Her request for a pledge (v. 18) will soon expose him, much like Nathan&#8217;s parable laid bare David&#8217;s sin (<a href=\"/2_samuel/12-7.htm\">2 Samuel 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The negotiation spotlights Judah&#8217;s short-sightedness. He is willing to part with his seal, cord, and staff&#8212;personal identifiers&#8212;just to satisfy momentary lust, paralleling Esau who &#8220;sold his birthright for a single meal&#8221; (<a href=\"/hebrews/12-16.htm\">Hebrews 12:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Tamar is not selling her body for profit; she is securing evidence.

Out of this encounter will come Perez, ancestor of King David and ultimately Christ (<a href=\"/ruth/4-18.htm\">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href=\"/matthew/1-3.htm\">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><hr color=\"#eeeeee\"><b>summary</b><p><a href=\"/genesis/38-16.htm\">Genesis 38:16</a> records a real, morally charged encounter that reveals Judah&#8217;s spiritual blindness, deliberate pursuit of sin, and willingness to barter integrity for gratification. At the same time, it displays Tamar&#8217;s bold strategy to obtain the justice Judah withheld, setting the stage for God to preserve the messianic line through unlikely means. The verse warns believers of sin&#8217;s deceptive pull, the cost of unchecked desire, and the faithfulness of God to work even through human failure to accomplish His redemptive plan.<div class=\"vheading2\"><a href=\"/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm\">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class=\"cmt_sub_title\">Verse 16.</span> - <span class=\"cmt_word\">And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee</span>; (<span class=\"cmt_word\">for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law</span>). Though willing to commit adultery or fornication, Judah would have shrank from the sin of incest. <span class=\"cmt_word\">And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</span> The conduct of Tamer, though in every way reprehensible, is not to be attributed to mere lust, or inordinate desire for offspring, if not from the son Shelah, then from the father Judah, but was probably traceable to a secret wish on the one hand to be avenged on Judah, and on the other hand to assert her right to a place amongst the ancestresses of the patriarchal family. Yet Tamar was really guilty of both adultery and incest, though Lange thinks the wickedness of Er and Onan renders this open to question. <span class=\"p\"><br /><br /></span><span class=\"versiontext\"><a href=\"/commentaries/genesis/38-16.htm\">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class=\"p\"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name=\"lexicon\" id=\"lexicon\"></a><div class=\"vheading\">Hebrew</div><span class=\"word\">Not</span><br /><span class=\"heb\">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class=\"translit\">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class=\"parse\">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class=\"str\"><a href=\"/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm\">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class=\"str2\">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class=\"word\">realizing</span><br /><span class=\"heb\">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;</span> <span class=\"translit\">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class=\"parse\">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class=\"str\"><a href=\"/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm\">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class=\"str2\">To know</span><br /><br /><span class=\"word\">that</span><br /><span class=\"heb\">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class=\"translit\">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class=\"parse\">Conjunction<br /></span><span class=\"str\"><a href=\"/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm\">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class=\"str2\">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class=\"word\">she</span><br /><span class=\"heb\">&#1492;&#1460;&#1425;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class=\"translit\">(h&#238;)</span><br /><span class=\"parse\">Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class=\"str\"><a href=\"/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm\">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class=\"str2\">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class=\"word\">was his daughter-in-law,</span><br /><span class=\"heb\">&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class=\"translit\">(&#7733;al&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class=\"parse\">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
