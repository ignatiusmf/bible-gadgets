The serpent, identified later in Scripture as Satan (<a href=\"/revelation/12-9.htm\">Revelation 12:9</a>), is addressed directly by God, indicating the seriousness of the transgression. The use of \"LORD God\" emphasizes God's authority and sovereignty. The serpent's role in the fall of man marks the beginning of enmity between humanity and evil, a theme that runs throughout the Bible.<p><b>Because you have done this:</b><br>The phrase refers to the serpent's deception of Eve, leading to the fall of humanity. This act of deception is pivotal in the narrative of sin entering the world. It highlights the serpent's cunning nature and sets the stage for the ongoing spiritual battle between good and evil. This moment is foundational for understanding the need for redemption and the eventual coming of Christ.<p><b>Cursed are you above all livestock and every beast of the field!</b><br>The curse pronounced on the serpent is unique and severe, indicating its role in the fall. The comparison to livestock and beasts underscores the serpent's degradation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, serpents were often seen as symbols of chaos and evil, which aligns with the biblical portrayal. This curse foreshadows the ultimate defeat of Satan, as seen in <a href=\"/revelation/20-10.htm\">Revelation 20:10</a>.<p><b>On your belly will you go,</b><br>This phrase suggests a change in the serpent's form or status, symbolizing humiliation and defeat. The imagery of crawling on the belly is associated with subjugation and disgrace. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of rebellion against God. This imagery is echoed in <a href=\"/isaiah/65-25.htm\">Isaiah 65:25</a>, where peace is restored, and the serpent's role is diminished.<p><b>And dust you will eat,</b><br>Eating dust is a metaphor for total defeat and subjugation. In the ancient world, dust was often associated with death and mourning. This phrase signifies the serpent's ultimate humiliation and the futility of its rebellion. It also points to the ongoing struggle between humanity and evil, culminating in Christ's victory over sin and death.<p><b>All the days of your life.</b><br>The perpetual nature of the curse indicates that the serpent's defeat is ongoing and eternal.

Each phrase unveils the seriousness of sin, God&#8217;s unchallenged authority, and His unfolding plan to overturn evil through the promised Redeemer.<div class=\"vheading2\"><a href=\"/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/3.htm\">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14, 15) <span class= \"bld\">Unto the serpent.</span>--As the serpent had tempted our first parents purposely and consciously in order to lead them into sin, he stood there without excuse, and received a threefold penalty. The outward form of the condemnation is made suitable to the shape which the tempter had assumed; but the true force and meaning, especially in the last and most intense portion of the sentence, belong, not to the animal, but to Satan himself. The serpent is but the type: diabolic agency the reality. First, therefore, the serpent is condemned to crawl. As he is pronounced to be \"cursed above (or rather, <span class= \"ital\">among</span>) all cattle\"--that is, the tame animals subjected to man's service--and also \"among all beasts of the field\"--that is, the wild animals, but a term not applicable to reptiles--it has been supposed that the serpent was originally erect and beautiful, and that Adam had even tamed serpents, and had them in his household. But such a transformation belongs to the region of fable, and the meaning is that henceforward the serpent's crawling motion is to be to it a mark of disgrace, and to Satan a sign of meanness and contempt. He won the victory over our guileless first parents, and still he winds in and out among men, ever bringing degradation with him, and ever sinking with his victims into deeper abysses of shame and infamy. Yet, even so, perpetually he suffers defeat, and has, secondly, to \"lick the dust,\" because his mean devices lead, as in this place, only to the manifestation of God's glory. In the <span class= \"ital\">Paradise Lost </span>Milton has made Satan a hero, though fallen; really he is a despicable and mean-spirited foe, whose strength lies in man's moral feebleness. Finally, there is perpetual enmity between the serpent and man. The adder in the path bites man's heel, and is crushed beneath his tramp. It has been noticed that in spite of the beauty and gracefulness of many of the species, man's loathing of them is innate; while in hot countries they are his great enemy, the deaths in India, for instance, from snake-bites being many times more than those caused by the carnivora.<p><span class= \"bld\">Her seed </span>. . . <span class= \"bld\">shall bruise thy head.</span>--We have here the sum of the whole matter, and the rest of the Bible does but explain the nature of this struggle, the persons who wage it, and the manner and consequences of the victory. Here, too, we learn the end and purpose for which the narrative is cast in its present form. It pictures to us man in a close and loving relation, not to an abstract deity, but to a personal and covenant Jehovah. This Being with tender care plants for him a garden, gathers into it whatever is most rare and beautiful in vegetation, and, having given it to him for his home, even deigns at eventide to walk with him there. In the care of this garden He provides for Adam pleasant employment, and watches the development of his intellect with such interest as a father feels in the mental growth of his child. Day by day He brings new animals within his view; and when, after studying their habits, he gives them names, the Deity shares man's tranquil enjoyment. And when he still feels a void, and needs a companion who can hold with him rational discourse, Jehovah elaborately fashions for him, out of his own self, a second being, whose presence satisfies all his longings. Meanwhile, in accordance with the universal law that hand in hand with free-will goes responsibility, an easy and simple trial is provided for man's obedience. He fails, and henceforward he must wage a sterner conflict, and attain to victory only by effort and suffering. In this struggle man is finally to prevail, but not unscathed. And his triumph is to be gained not by mere human strength, but by the coming of One who is \"the Woman's Seed;\" and round this promised Deliverer the rest of Scripture groups itself. Leave out these words, and all the inspired teaching which follows would be an ever-widening river without a fountain-head. But necessarily with the fall came the promise of restoration. Grace is no after-thought, but enters the world side by side with sin. Upon this foundation the rest of Holy Scripture is built, till revelation at last reaches its corner-stone in Christ. The outward form of the narrative affords endless subjects for curious discussion; its inner meaning and true object being to lay the broad basis of all future revealed truth.<p>As regards the reading of the Vulgate and some of the Fathers, <span class= \"ital\">ipsa conteret, </span>\"she shall bruise,\" not only is the pronoun masculine in the Hebrew, but also the verb. This too is the case in the Syriac, in which language also verbs have genders. Most probably a critical edition of the Vulgate would restore even there <span class= \"ital\">ipse conteret, </span>\"he shall bruise.\"<p>Like a large proportion of the words used in Genesis, the verb is rare, being found only twice elsewhere in Scripture. In <a href=\"/job/9-17.htm\" title=\"For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.\">Job 9:17</a> the meaning seems plainly to be <span class= \"ital\">to break, </span>but in <a href=\"/psalms/139-11.htm\" title=\"If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.\">Psalm 139:11</a>, where, however, J the reading is uncertain, the sense required is <span class= \"ital\">to cover</span> or <span class= \"ital\">veil, </span>though Dr. Kay translates <span class= \"ital\">overwhelm. </span>Some versions in this place translate it <span class= \"ital\">observe; </span>and the Vulgate gives two renderings, namely, \"She shall <span class= \"ital\">bruise </span>thy head, and thou shalt <span class= \"ital\">lie in ambush </span>for (his or her) heel\" (gender not marked--<span class= \"ital\">calcaneo ejus</span>)<span class= \"ital\">. </span>The translation of the Authorised Version may be depended upon as correct, in spite of its not being altogether applicable to the attack of a natural serpent upon a wayfarer's heel.<p><div class=\"vheading2\"><a href=\"/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm\">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class=\"cmt_sub_title\">Verse 14.</span> - Confession having thus been made by both delinquents, and the arch-contriver of the whole mischief discovered, the Divine Judge proceeds to deliver sentence. <span class=\"cmt_word\">And the Lord God said unto the serpent</span>.

Adam, as the first man, represents humanity, and his actions have implications for all his descendants. This moment marks a pivotal point in biblical history, where the relationship between God and man is altered due to disobedience.<p><b>Because you have listened to the voice of your wife</b><br>Adam's decision to heed Eve's suggestion over God's command illustrates the theme of misplaced priorities and the consequences of failing to uphold divine instruction. This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God above all else, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. It also reflects the dynamics of human relationships and the potential for leading one another astray, as seen in other biblical narratives such as Solomon's marriages leading him to idolatry (<a href=\"/1_kings/11.htm\">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>).<p><b>and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat,</b><br>This act of disobedience is central to the Fall narrative. The tree represents the boundary set by God, and eating from it signifies the breach of divine law. The command not to eat from the tree is a test of obedience and trust in God's wisdom. This disobedience introduces sin into the world, a theme that is echoed in <a href=\"/romans/5-12.htm\">Romans 5:12</a>, where Paul discusses how sin entered the world through one man.<p><b>cursed is the ground because of you;</b><br>The curse on the ground signifies a fundamental change in the created order, affecting the environment and humanity's relationship with it. This curse introduces hardship into human labor and reflects the broader consequences of sin affecting all creation, as seen in <a href=\"/romans/8-20.htm\">Romans 8:20-22</a>, where creation is described as being subjected to frustration and longing for redemption.<p><b>through toil you will eat of it</b><br>This phrase highlights the shift from the ease of life in Eden to a life of labor and struggle. The concept of toil reflects the broader biblical theme of work and its challenges, as seen in <a href=\"/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm\">Ecclesiastes 2:22-23</a>, where the Preacher reflects on the burdensome nature of labor.
